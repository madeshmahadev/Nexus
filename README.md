### Abstract
I'm happy to pitch a forum called NEXUS a microblogging and social networking platform
functioned by the Sketch club of CSE Department. This portal is designed specifically for
communication with the university. Communication here is transparent, which allows the students
to communicate with higher levels addressing some issues that are happening in the college,
officials can use this portal for public announcements and this information is circulated only within
the campus. It's a secure portal that allows users to communicate harassment and users can view
the status of the grievances.

### Usage and Benefits:
*  Students can tag Faculties or Officials directly if they are facing any troubles inside campus.
*  It will help students to know the official announcements
*  This forum has Likes/Dislike/Comment sections like any social media so that if there are any spam or vulnerability, officials can delete them or share their thoughts about it.
*  Department or Students’ Club can broadcast their posters, register forms, updates and event photos.
*  Alumni can help students get placed at their respective organizations, provide Mentorship and Scholarships, also can play an active role in voluntary programmes like mentoring students in their areas of expertise by using Nexus Forum a medium to broadcast.
*  The account is encrypted such a way that none can try to access any officials account if happen so they will be intimated quickly.
